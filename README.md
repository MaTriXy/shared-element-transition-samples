# Shared Transition Playground

This repo is a proof-of-concept sample, demoing the correct way to do shared element transitions
between two Activities or two Fragments (going from a list to a detail view).

# Source Structure

No specific architecture pattern is used...

* `MainActivity` displays the two buttons to either show the `Activity` -> `Activity` sample, or the
`Fragment` -> `Fragment` sample.
* `SourceActivity` is the list `Activity` which transitions into the `TargetActivity` detail screen.
* `FragmentContainerActivity` contains the list `SourceFragment`, which transitions into the
`TargetFragment` detail screen.
* `GlideImageView` is a simple custom `View` that waits to actually load an image until it is measured.
It keeps track of the URL that is set to it, even if it's not ready yet. As the name suggests, it uses
Glide for downloading the image.
* `DetailsTransition` was taken from *Bryan Herbst's* [medium article](https://medium.com/@bherbst/fragment-transitions-with-shared-elements-7c7d71d31cbb#.2j1txydy2), one small part was removed.
* `ImageUtil` is a basic utility class that gets the URL for a target.com thumbnail, in a requested size.
* And of course, `MainAdapter` is used in screens which display a list (`RecyclerView`).
